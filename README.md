# USDA-Hack-Meat-Sensor
How we're going to do it:
1. Find the largest grouping of red
2. Find the white within the red
3. Find the ratio of red to while within the target area
4. Convert the ratio to a grade


## About the project:
#### Three primary quality designations:
- Prime - best
- Choice - middle
- Select - lowest

#### How to grade:
- Marbling
  - Intramuscular fat
    - Amount
    - Texture
    - Distribution
   
#### Resources:
- 1400 images
- marbling score goes from 100-1100
- additional 500 images for validation of accuracy and consistency
  - 300-399 - select ~15%
  - 400-499 - low choice ~ 50%
  - 500-699 - upper 2/3rds choice ~ 35%
  - 700+ - prime ~ 19%
